    <h3>Tips!</h3>
    <p>A lot of cooking is in the <em>way</em> something is cooked, below are some tips I've found out through my time cooking this dish!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not take the lid off the rice at all during cooking! Trust the process, the water may look like it's gone, but it's not.</li>
        <li>You can add Jalepenos for more of a kick if you'd like</li>
        <li>Sour cream is an optional, but welcome addition</li>
        <li>Chop the chicken up into fine pieces, mix with the rice and add some refried beans. Finally wrap in a tortilla for an unreal burrito!</li>
