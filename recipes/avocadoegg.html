    <h3>Tips!</h3>
    <p>A lot of cooking is in the <em>way</em> something is cooked, below are some tips I've found out through my time cooking this dish!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A squirt of any sort of acid in the egg water before adding the eggs help them stay together.</li>
        <li>You can use extra salt, pepper and chilli flakes as garnish once the meal is assembled.</li>
        <li>An additional 15 seconds in the water will result in a firmer, but still runny yolk.</li>
        <li>If you're worried the eggs may be over cooking, cut them open slightly as soon as they're placed on the toast.</li>
    </ul>
