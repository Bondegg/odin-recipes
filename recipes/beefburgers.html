    <h3>The Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a griddle pan to medium high, add half the olive oil and bring to temp</li>
        <li>Portion the mince into x4 125g balls, add some seasoning if you wish</li>
        <li>Place 2 of the balls in the griddle pan and squish down hard with a meat mallet, making the mince as thing as possible, cook for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook for a further 3 minutes, do not squish down this side!</li>
        <li>Take off the griddle and leave to rest, repeat steps 2 to 4 with the two remaining mince balls</li>
        <li>Cut your buns in half, lather them generously with butter and place under a 180c grill for at least 4 minutes, or until golden brown</li>
        <li>Place bacon in to an airfryer, oven or pan fry until cooked. Place to one side</li>
        <li>Cut your lettuce into shreds, place a handfull of shredded lettuce onto the bottom of each burger</li>
        <li>Create the burger by layering a burger patty with a cheese slice, repeat and then finally top with bacon</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips!</h3>
    <p>A lot of cooking is in the <em>way</em> something is cooked, below are some tips I've found out through my time cooking this dish!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can add whatever toppings you like to this, I personally favour mayo, diced pickles and grilled onions, but you can add whatever floats your boat!</li>
        <li>Not squishing the burger once it's flipped is integral, you want the juices to suck back up for a nice juicy bite.</li>
        <li>If you don't want to smash your burgers, this recipe still works. Just adjust cooking times as necessary</li>
    </ul>
