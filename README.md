TheOdinProject Project: Recipies

This is a small website that will be dedicated to showing what I have learnt so far with TOP. It will include a basic webpage that is setup with a basic HTML boilerplate, include header, paragraph and anchor tags with relevant attributes to navigate around the site.
The site is not expected to look pretty at this point.

These will be some genuine favourite recipes of mine.
